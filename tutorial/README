1. FEniCS101 notebook illustrates the use of FEniCS for the solution of a linear boundary value problem.
2. PoissonDeterministic notebook illustrates how to compute gradient and Hessian information and solve a non-linear parameter inversion for the Poisson equation in a deterministic setting. 
3. SubsurfaceBayesian notebook illustrates how to solve a non-linear parameter inversion for the Poisson equation in a Bayesian setting.
4. AdvectionDiffusionBayesian notebook illustrates how to solve a time-dependent linear inverse problem in a Bayesian setting.
5. HessianSpectrum notebook illustrates the spectral property of the Hessian operator for a linear source inversion problem.

To run the notebook open a FEniCS terminal and type

$ jupyter notebook

A new tab will open in your web-brower showing the notebooks.
