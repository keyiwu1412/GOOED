Goal-oriented optimal experimental design for Bayesian linear inverse problem


The code runs in the environment of  `hIPPYlib`  (https://hippylib.github.io)

Numerical experiment on advection-diffusion model in
/hippylib/gooed/adv_predict9.py for 9 candidate sensors
/hippylib/gooed/adv_predict75.py for 75 candidate sensors
